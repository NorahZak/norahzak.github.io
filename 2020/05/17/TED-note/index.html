<h3 id="The-revolutional-power-of-diverse-thoughts"><a href="#The-revolutional-power-of-diverse-thoughts" class="headerlink" title="The revolutional power of diverse thoughts"></a>The revolutional power of diverse thoughts</h3><p>‘Can you taste words ?’ It was a question that caught me by surprise . The summer I was giving a tour containing the tree festival , and afterwards I was signing books , a teenage girl came with her friends , and this was what she asked me . I told her that some people experience an  overlap in their senses , so that they could hear colors , or see songs . And many wisers are fascinated by this subject , myself included . But she cut me off , being unpatient, ‘Yeah I know that staff , we call it athesia . We’ve learned it in school . But my mom is reading your book , and she says there is lots of food , and ingredients , and the long dinner ? that she gets hungry at every page . So I was thinking , how come you don’t get hungry when you write , and I thought maybe you could taste words . It makes sense .’ And actually it did make sense , because ever since my childhood , each letter in the alphabet has a different color , and colors bring me flavors . So ? is the color purple is quite punjent? almost perfumed , and any word that was associated with purple taste the same way , such as sunset is a very spicy word . But I was worried that if I tell all of this to the teenager , it might sound either too abstruct or perhaps too weird . And there wasn’t enough time anyhow , because people were waiting in the queue . So it suddenly felt like what I was trying to convey was more complicated and detailed than what the circumstances allowed me to say . And I did what I usually do in similar situations - I stumbled , I shut down , and I stop talking . I stop talking because the truth was complicated , even though I knew deep inside that one should never ever remain silent for fear of complexity .</p>
<p>So I want to start my talk today with the unsaid that I was not able to give on that day - yes , I can taste words . Sometimes , that is not always . And happy words have different flavor than sad words . I like to explore how does the word ‘creativity’ taste like , or ‘equality ‘, ‘love ‘, ‘revolution ‘. And what about ‘motherland ‘?  These days it’s particularly this last word that troubles me . It leaves a sweet taste on my tongue , like ? and golden apples . But underneath there’s a sharp tongue like ? and ?. The taste of my motherland , Turkey , is a mixture of sweet and bitter . And there is a ? I’m telling you this because I think there are more and more people all around the world , who has similarly mixed emotions about the land where they came from . We love our native countries , yeah , how can we not ? We feel attached to the people , the culture , the food. And yet at the same time , we are increasingly frustrated for the politics and politicians , sometimes for the ? hurt , or anger . </p>
<p>I want to talk about emotions and the need to boost out emotional intelligence .  I think it’s a pity that main political theory pays very little attention to emotions . Often times , experts and analysts are too busy with data and metrics , that they seemed to forget those things in life that are difficult to measure and perhaps impossible to cluster under statistical models . But I think this is a mistake for 2 main reasons : firstly , because we are emotional beings , as human beings I think we are all like that , but secondly - and this is new - I think we’ve enter the new stage in world history in which collective sentiments guides and misguides politicians more than ever before . And through social media and social networking , these sentiments are further amplified , polarized , and they travel around the world quite fast . Ours is the age of anxiety , anger , distrust , resentment, and I think lots of fear . But here is the thing : even though there’s plenty of research about economical factors , there’s relatively few studies about emotional factors .  Why is that we underestimate feelings and perceptions ? I think it’s gonna be one of our biggest intellectual challenges , because our political systems are ? with emotion . And country after country , we’ve seen illegal politicians exploiting these emotions . And yet within the acemedia, we’re yet to take emotions seriously .</p>
<h3 id="The-beautiful-tricks-of-flowers"><a href="#The-beautiful-tricks-of-flowers" class="headerlink" title="The beautiful tricks of flowers"></a>The beautiful tricks of flowers</h3><p>Do you know how many species of <del>flowers</del> flowering plants <del>are there in Armstrong</del> there are ? <del>A</del> There are a quarter of a million , at least , <del>that’s</del> those are the ones <del>you</del> who we know about <del>it</del> . A quarter of a million species of <del>flowers</del> flowering plants <del>in the planet</del> . </p>
<p>Flowers are a real <del>abundant</del> <u>bugger</u> . They’re <del>already</del> really difficult for plants to <del>reproduce</del> produce . <u>They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources</u> . Why would they <del>get</del> go to that <del>border</del> bother ? The answer <del>is</del> - of course , like so many things <u>in the world</u> - is sex . I know what ‘s on your mind when <del>you see those</del> you’re looking at these pictures . And the reason why sexual reproduction is so important , there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce . You can take <del>cottons</del> cuttings , they can <u>sort of</u> have sex with themselves , <u>they can pollinate themselves</u> . But they really need to spread their <del>pollen</del> genes to <del>make without the pollen</del> mix with other genes so they can adapt to environmental niches . Evolutions work that way . </p>
<p>Now <del>why</del> that plants <del>transform</del> <u>transmit</u> that information through <del>that</del> pollen . <u>Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before . As I say , every home should have a scanning electron</u> microscope <u>to be able to see these</u> . There are many different kinds of pollen as <del>they are in flower in</del> there’re flowering plants . <del>I’m not a sexuality ?</del> <u>And that’s actually rather forensics and</u> so on . <u>Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen , and that’s a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up to our noses so much .</u> . <del>We need to check on</del> Because you need to chuck out masses of masses of it , <u>hoping that your sex cells , your male sex cells , which are held within the pollen , will somehow reach another flower</u> just by chance . So all the grasses, <u>which means all of the <del>serial</del> cereal crops and most of the trees</u> have <del>wind blow</del> wind-borne pollen .</p>
<p>But most species actually use insects to do <del>that</del> their bidding . And that’s more intelligent in a way , because the pollen , <u>they don’t need so</u> much of it , insects and other species can take the pollen , <del>transformed</del> transfer it directly to where it’s required . </p>
<p><u>So we’re aware , obviously , of</u> the relationship between insects and <del>flowers</del> plants . <u>There’s a symbiotic relationship here</u> ,  whether it’s flies or birds or bees , <u>they are getting something in return , and that something in return is generally nectar</u> .</p>
<h3 id="Virtual-choir-live"><a href="#Virtual-choir-live" class="headerlink" title="Virtual choir live"></a>Virtual choir live</h3><p>In 1991, I had made the most profound and transforming experience in my life . I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree . I took a couple of victory laps? in here . And … in northern California . … we were relaxing at the beautiful lake of … and the ? and birds and crows making noise .</p>
<h3 id="What-really-happens-to-the-plastic-you-throw-away"><a href="#What-really-happens-to-the-plastic-you-throw-away" class="headerlink" title="What really happens to the plastic you throw away"></a>What really happens to the plastic you throw away</h3><p>This is the story of three plastic bottles , empty and discarded . Their journeys are about to diverge with outcomes that impact nothing less than the fate of the planet . But they weren’t always this way .</p>
<p>To understand where these bottles end up , we must first explore their origins . The heroes of our story are <u>conceived</u> in these oil <u>refinery</u> . The plastic in their bodies was formed by chemically bonding oil and gas <u>molecules</u> together to make <u>monomers</u> . In <u>turn</u> , these monomers were bonded into long <u>polymer</u> chains to make plastic in the form of millions of <u>pellets</u>  . Those were melted in <u>manufacturing plants</u> ,  and reformed in <u>molds</u> to create the resilient material that makes up the triplets’ bodies . Machine filled those bottles with sweet <u>bubbly</u> liquid , and they were wrapped , shipped, bought , opened , consumed , and <u>unceremoniously</u> discarded . And here they lie , <u>poised at</u> the edge of unknown . </p>
<p>Bottle 1, like hundreds and millions of tons of his plastic <u>brethren</u> , ends up in a <u>landfill</u> . This huge <u>dump</u> expand each day as more trash comes in and continues to take up space . As plastic sit there being compressed <u>amongst</u> layers of other <u>junk</u> , rainwater flows through the waste , and absorbs the <u>water-soluble</u> compounds it contains , and some of those are highly toxic . Together , they create a harmful <u>stew</u> called leachate , which can move into groundwater , soil and streams , poisoning ecosystems and harming wildlife . It can take bottle 1 an <u>agonizing</u> 1000 years to decompose . </p>
<p>Bottle 2’s journey is a little stranger , but unfortunately no happier . He floats on a <u>trickle</u> that reaches a stream , a stream that flows into the river , and a river that reaches the ocean . After months’ lost at sea , he’s slowly drown into a massive <u>vortex</u> , where trash accumulates . A place known as The great Pacific garbage patch  . Here the ocean’s currents have trapped millions of pieces of plastic <u>debris</u> . This is one of 5 plastic-filled <u>gyres</u> in the world’s  seas , places where the pollutants turn the water into a cloudy plastic soup . Some animals , like seabirds , get entangled in the <u>mess</u> . They , and others , mistake the brightly colored plastic bits for food . Plastics make them feel full when they’re not , so they starve to death , and pass the toxins from the plastic up the food chain . For example , it’s eaten by lanternfish , the lanternfish are eaten by squid , the squid are eaten by tuna , by the tuna are eaten by us . And most plastics don’t <u>biodegrade</u> , which means they’re <u>destined</u> to break down into smaller and smaller pieces , called micro plastics , which might <u>rotate</u> in the sea eternally .</p>
<p>But bottle 3 is <u>spared</u> the cruel <u>purgatories</u> of his brothers . A truck brings it to a <u>plant</u> , where he and his companions are squeezed flat , and compressed into a block . Ok , this sounds pretty bad , too , but hang in there , it gets better . The blocks are shredded into tiny pieces , which are washed and melted , so they become the raw materials that can be used again . As if by magic , bottle 3 is now ready to <u>reborn</u> as  something completely new . For this bit of plastic with such humble origins , suddenly the sky is the limit.</p>
<h3 id="Why-do-cats-act-so-weird"><a href="#Why-do-cats-act-so-weird" class="headerlink" title="Why do cats act so weird?"></a>Why do cats act so weird?</h3><p>They are cute , they are lovable , and judging by the 26 billion views of over 2 million YouTube videos of them <u>pouncing</u> , bouncing , climbing , <u>cramming</u> , stalking , <u>clawing</u> , chattering and purring , one thing is certain : cats are very entertaining .</p>
<p>These somewhat strange <u>feline</u> behaviors , both amusing and <u>baffling</u> , leave many of us asking : why do cats do that ? </p>
<p><u>Throughout</u> time , cats were simultaneously <u>solitary</u> predators of smaller animals and prey for larger <u>carnivores</u> . As both predator and prey , survival of their species depended on crucial instinctual behaviors , which we still observe in wild and domestic cats today .</p>
<p>While the feline actions of your house cat Grazmale might seem <u>perplexing</u> , in the wild these same behaviors naturally bred into cats for millions of years would make Grazmale a super cat .</p>
<p>Enabled by their unique muscular structure and keen balancing abilities , cats climbed to high <u>vantage</u> points to survey their territory and spot prey in the wild . Grazmale doesn’t need these particular skills to find and hunt down dinners in her food bowl today , but instinctually , viewing the living room from top of the bookcase is exactly what she has evolved to do .</p>
<p>As wild predators , cats are opportunistic and hunt whenever prey is available . Since most cat prey are small , cats in the wild needed to eat many times each day , and use a stock-pounce-kill-eat strategy to stay <u>fed</u> . This is why Grazmale prefers to chase and bounce on little toys and eat small meals over the course of day and night . </p>
<p>Also , small prey tend to hide in tiny spaces in their natural environments , so one explanations for Grazmale’s <u>propensity</u> to reach into containers and openings is that she is <u>compelled</u> by the same curiosity that helped ensure the continuation of her species from millions of years before .</p>
<p>In the wild , cats needed sharp claws for climbing , hunting and self-defense . Sharpening claws on nearby surfaces kept them conditioned and ready , helped stretch their back and leg muscles , and <u>relieve</u> some stress , too . So it’s not that Grazmale hates your <u>couch</u> , chair , <u>ottoman</u> , pillows , curtains and everything else you put in her environment . She is <u>ripping</u> these things to shreds and keeping her claws in tip-top shape , because this is exactly what her ancestors did in order to survive .</p>
<p>As animals that were preyed upon , cats evolved to not get caught , and in the wild , the cats <u>that were the best at  avoiding predators thrived</u> . So at your home today , Grazmale is an expert at squeezing into small spaces and seeking out and hiding in unconventional spots . It also explains why she prefers a clean and <u>odor</u>-free litter box , that’s less likely to give away her location to any predators that may be sniffing around nearby .</p>
<p>Considering everything we do know about cats , it seems that one of their most predominant behaviors is still one of the most mysterious . Cats may purr for any number of reasons , such as happiness , stress and hunger . But curiously , the frequency of their purrs between 25 and 150 Hz is within a range that can promote <u>tissue</u> regeneration . So while her purring makes Grazmale an excellent nap companion , it is also possible that her purr is healing her muscles and bones , and maybe even yours , too .</p>
<p>They developed through time as both solitary predators that hunted and killed to eat , and <u>stealthy</u> prey hid and escaped to survive . So cats today <u>retain</u> many of the same instincts that allowed them to thrive in the wild for millions of years . This explains some of their seemingly strange behaviors . To them , our homes are their jungles , but if this is the case , in our own cats eyes , who are we ? Big , dumb , hairless cats competing with them for resources ? Terribly stupid predators they’re able to outsmart everyday ? Or maybe , they think we are the prey …</p>
<h3 id="How-the-food-you-eat-affects-your-brain"><a href="#How-the-food-you-eat-affects-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="How the food you eat affects your brain"></a>How the food you eat affects your brain</h3><p>If you sucked all of the <u>moisture</u> out of your brain and broke it down to its <u>constituent</u> nutritional content , what would it look like ?</p>
<p>Most of the weight of your dehydrated brain would come from fats , also known as <u>lipids</u> . In the remaining brain matter , you would find proteins and <u>amino</u> acids , traces of micronutrients , and <u>glucose</u> . The brain is , of course , more than just the sum of its nutritional parts . But each component does have a distinct impact on functioning , development , mood and energy . So that <u>post-lunch apathy</u> or late-night alertness you might be feeling , well , that could simply be the affects of foods on your brain .</p>
<p>Of the fats in your brain , the superstars are Omegas 3&amp;6. These essential fatty acids , which have been linked to preventing degenerative brain conditions , must come from our diets . So eating Omega-rich food like nuts , seeds and fatty fish is crucial to the creation and maintenance of cell <u>membranes</u> . And while Omegas are good fats for your brain , long-term consumption of other fats , like trans and saturated fats , may <u>compromise</u> brain health .</p>
<p>Meanwhile , proteins and amino acids , the building block nutrients of growth and development , manipulate how we feel and behave . Amino acids contain the <u>precursors</u> to <u>neurotransmitters</u> - the chemical messengers that carry signals between neurons , affecting things like mood , sleep , attentiveness and weight . They’re one of the reasons we might feel calm after eating a large plate of pasta or more alert after a protein-rich meal . The complex combination of compounds in food can stimulate brain cells to release <u>mood-altering norepinephrine , dopamine and serotonin</u> . But getting into your brain cells is tricky , and amino acids have to compete for limited access . A diet with a range of foods helps maintain a balanced combination of brain messengers , and keeps your mood from getting <u>skewed</u> in one direction or the other .</p>
<p>Like the other organs in our bodies , our brains also benefit from a steady supply of micronutrients . <u>Antioxidants</u> in fruits and vegetables strengthen the brain to fight off <u>free radicals</u> that destroy brain cells , enabling your brain to work well for a longer period of time . And without powerful micronutrients like the vitamins B6 , B12 and <u>folic</u> acid , our brains would be <u>susceptible</u> to brain disease and mental decline . Trace amounts of the <u>mineral , iron , copper , zinc and sodium</u> are also fundamental to brain health and early cognitive development . </p>
<p>In order for the brain to efficiently transform and synthesize these valuable nutrients , it needs fuel , and lots of it . While the human brain only makes up about 2% of our body weight , it uses up to 20% of our energy resources . Most of these energy comes from <u>carbohydrates</u> that our body digests into glucose or blood sugar . The <u>frontal lobes</u> are so sensitive to drops in glucose  , in fact , that a change in mental function is one of the primary signals of nutrient <u>deficiency</u> . Assuming that we’re getting glucose regularly , how does this specific type of carbohydrates we eat affect our brains ? Carbs come in 3 forms : <u>starch</u> , sugar and <u>fiber</u> . While on most nutrition labels , they’re all <u>lumped</u> into one total carb count . The ratio of the sugar and fiber subgroups to the whole amount affect how the body and brain respond . A high-<u>glycemic</u> food , like white bread , causes a rapid release if glucose into blood , and then comes the <u>dip</u> . Blood sugar shoots down , and with it , our attention span and mood . On the other hand , oats , <u>grains</u> and <u>legumes</u> have slower glucose release , enabling a steadier level of attentiveness . </p>
<p>For <u>sustained</u> brain power , opting for a varied diet of nutrient-rich food is critical . When it comes to what you bite , chew and swallow , your choices have a direct and long-lasting affect on the most powerful organ of your body .</p>
<h3 id="The-language-of-lying"><a href="#The-language-of-lying" class="headerlink" title="The language of lying"></a>The language of lying</h3><p>“Sorry , my phone died .”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing , I’m fine .”</p>
<p>These <u>allegations</u> are completely <u>unfounded</u> .</p>
<p>“The company was not aware of any <u>wrongdoing</u> .”</p>
<p>“I love you !”</p>
<p>We <u>hear anywhere from 10 to 200 lies</u> a day , and we’ve spent much of our history coming up with the ways to detect them , from <u>medieval</u> torture devices to <u>polygraphs</u> , blood-pressure and breathing monitors , voice-stress analyzers , eye trackers , <u>infrared</u> brain scanners and even the 400-pound <u>electroencephalogram</u> . But although such tools have worked under certain circumstances , most can be fooled with enough preparation , and none are considered reliable enough to be even admissible in court .</p>
<p>But what if the problem is not with the techniques , but the underlying assumption that lying <u>spurs</u> <u>physiological</u> changes ? What if we took a more direct approach , using communication science to analyze the lies themselves ?</p>
<p>On a psychological level , we lie partly to paint a better picture of ourselves , connecting our fantasies to the person we wish we were rather than the person we are . But while our brain is busy dreaming , it’s letting plenty of signals slip by . Our conscious mind only controls about 5% of our cognitive function , including communication , while the other 95% <u>occurs</u> beyond our awareness . And according to literature on reality monitoring , stories based on imagined experiences are <u>qualitatively</u> different from those based on real experiences . This suggests that creating a false story about a personal topic takes work and results in a different pattern of language use . A technology known as linguistic text analysis has helped to identify 4 such common patterns in the subconscious language of <u>deception</u> . </p>
<p>First , <u>liars</u> reference themselves less when making deceptive statements . They write or talk more about others , often using the third person to distance and dissociate themselves from their lie . Which sounds more false , “Absolutely no party took place at this house .” or “I didn’t host a party here .”</p>
<p>Second , liars tend to be more negative , because on a subconscious level , they feel guity about lying . For example , a liar might say something like , “Sorry , my stupid phone battery died . I hate that thing .”</p>
<p>Third , liars typically explain events in simple terms since our brains struggle to build a complex lie . Judgment and evaluation are complex things for our brains to compute . As a US president once famously insisted , “I did not have sexual relations with that woman .”</p>
<p>And finally , even <u>though</u> liars keep the descriptions simple , they tend to use longer and more convoluted sentence structure , inserting unnecessary words and <u>irrelevant</u> but factual-sounding details in order to <u>pad</u> the lie . Another president confronted with the scandal <u>proclaimed</u> , “I can say categorically that this investigation indicates that no one on the White House staff , no one in this administration presently employed , was involved in this very bizarre incident .”</p>
<p>Let’s apply linguistic analysis to some famous examples . Take 7-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong . When comparing a 2005 interview in which he had denied taking performance-enhancing drugs to a 2013 interview in which he admitted it , his use of personal <u>pronouns</u> increased nearly by three quarters . Note the contrast between the 2 following quotes :</p>
<p>“OK , you know , a guy in a French - in a Parisian laboratory opens up your sample , you know , John Francis so-and-so , and he tests it . And then you get a phone call from a newspaper that says we founded you to be positive 6 times for EPO…”</p>
<p>“I lost myself in all of that . I’m sure there would be other people that couldn’t handle it . But I certainly couldn’t handle it . And I was used to controlling everything in my life . I controlled every outcome in my life .”</p>
<p>In his denial , Armstrong described a hypothetical situation focused on someone else , removing himself from the situation entirely . In his admission , he owns his statements , <u>delving into</u> his personal emotions and motivations . </p>
<p>But the use of personal pronouns is just one indicator of deception . Let’s look at another example , from former senator and US presidential candidate , John Edwards .</p>
<p>“I only know the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby . I also have not been engaged in any activity or any description that requested , agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby .” Not only is that a pretty <u>long-winded</u> way to say , “The baby isn’t mine .” , but Edwards never calls the other parties by name , instead saying “that baby” , “the woman” and “the apparent father” . Now let’s see what he had to say when later admitting <u>paternity</u> . “I am Quinn’s father . I will do everything in my power to provide her with the love and support she deserves . “ The statement is short and direct , calling the child by name and addressing his role in her life .</p>
<p>So how can you apply these lie-spotting techniques to your life ? First , remember that many of the lies we encountered <u>on a daily basis</u> are far less serious than these examples , and may even be harmless . But it’s still worthwhile to be aware of <u>tell-tale</u> clues like :</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal self-reference</li>
<li>negative language </li>
<li>simple explanations </li>
<li>convoluted phrasing</li>
</ul>
<p>It just might help you avoid an overvalued stock , an ineffective product , or even a terrible relationship .</p>
<h3 id="How-playing-an-instrument-benefits-your-brain"><a href="#How-playing-an-instrument-benefits-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="How playing an instrument benefits your brain"></a>How playing an instrument benefits your brain</h3><p>Did you know that every time musicians pick up their instruments , there are fireworks going off all over their brain ? On the outside , they may look calm and focused , reading the music and making the precise and practical movements required . But inside their brains , there’s a party going on . How do we know this ? </p>
<p>Well , in the last few decades , neuroscientists have made enormous breakthroughs in understanding how our brains work by monitoring them in real-time with instruments like functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography scanners . When people are hooked up to these machines , tasks, such as  reading or doing math problems each have <u>corresponding</u> areas of the brain where activity can be observed . But when researchers got the participants to listen to music , they saw fireworks . Multiple areas in their brains were lighting up at once , as they processed the sound , took it apart to understand elements like melody and rhythm , and then put it all back together into unified musical experience . And our brains do all this work in the split second between when we first hear the music and when our foot starts to tap along .</p>
<p>But when scientists turned from observing the brains of music listeners to those of musicians , the little backyard fireworks became a <u>jubilee</u> . It turns out that while listening to music engages the brain in some pretty interesting activities , playing music is the brain’s equivalent of a full-body workout . The neuroscientists saw multiple areas of the brain light up , simultaneously processing different information in <u>intricate</u> , <u>interrelated</u> and <u>astonishingly fast</u> sequences .</p>
<p>But what is it about making music that sets the brain alight ? <u>The research is still fairly new</u> , but neuroscientists have a pretty good idea . Playing a musical instrument engages practically every area of the brain at once , especially the visual , auditory and motor <u>cortices</u> . And as with any other workout , disciplined , structured practice in playing music strengthens those brain functions , allowing us to apply that strength to other activities . The most obvious difference between listening to music and playing it is that the latter requires fine motor skills , which are controlled in both <u>hemispheres</u> of the brain . It also combines the linguistic and mathematical precision in which the left hemisphere is more involved with the novel and creative content that the right <u>excels in</u> . For these reasons , </p>
<p>playing music has been found to increase the volume and activity in the brain’s <u>corpus callosum</u> , the bridge between the two hemispheres , allowing the messages to get across the brain faster and through more diverse routes . This may allow musicians to solve problems more effectively and creatively in both academic and social settings .</p>
<p>Because making music also involves crafting and understanding its emotional content and message , musicians often have higher levels of executive function , a category of <u>interlinked</u> tasks that includes planning , strategizing and attention to detail , and requires simultaneous analysis of both cognitive and emotional aspects . This ability also has an impact on how our memory systems work . And indeed , musicians exhibit enhanced memory functions , creating , storing and retrieving memories more quickly and efficiently . Studies have found that musicians appear to use their highly-connected brains to give each memory multiple tags , such as a conceptual tag , an emotional tag and audio tag and contextual tag , like a good Internet search engine .</p>
<p>So how do we know that all these benefits are unique to music , as opposed to say sports or painting ? Or could it be that people who go into music were already smarter to begin with ? Neuroscientists have explored these issues , but so far they’ve found the artistic and <u>aesthetic</u> aspects of learning to play a musical instrument are different from any other activity studied , including other arts . And several randomized studies of participants , who show the same levels of cognitive function and neural processing at the start , found that those who were exposed to a period of music learning showed enhancement in multiple brain areas compared to the others . This recent research about the mental benefits of playing music has advanced our understanding of mental function , revealing the inner rhythms and complex interplay that make up the amazing orchestra of our brain .</p>
